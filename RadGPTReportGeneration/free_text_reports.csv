1,0,0,0,"CT Chest with contrast

HISTORY: This examination was performed to evaluate a possible chest mass.

COMPARISON: The images were compared with an older chest study from a previous date.

FULL RESULT: The study was obtained using serial axial images of the chest after administering 75 mL of iodinated contrast. Coronal, sagittal, and axial MIP reconstructions were performed on modern CT equipment with radiation dose reduction techniques in place.

TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial slices were acquired, and both volume and dose minimization protocols were utilized to achieve an appropriate balance between image quality and patient safety.

FINDINGS: The thyroid gland appears within normal limits. There are small lung micronodules measuring under 4 mm, but there is no definite mass in the thorax. The major airways remain patent, and there is no fluid around the lungs or in the pericardial space. The mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph node regions are not enlarged. The heart size is normal, and the thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber. In the upper abdomen, the pancreatic head shows mild atrophy, but the liver and kidneys show no tumor. Skeletal structures do not reveal suspicious lesions.

IMPRESSION: There is no evident chest mass. The scattered pulmonary micronodules under 4 mm are nonspecific, and follow-up recommendations depend on the patient�s risk factors. No tumor is seen in the liver, pancreas, or kidney.",,
2,1,0,0,"HISTORY: The patient has a history of an ovarian malignancy and was referred for restaging to assess treatment response.

COMPARISON STUDY: Imaging from two prior dates was used for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: The patient underwent CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on a multi-detector scanner. Precontrast images were obtained through the abdomen, and post-contrast images covered the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after an IV infusion of roughly 125 mL of nonionic contrast. Oral contrast was also administered. The data were reconstructed in thin and slightly thicker slices for comprehensive review, and radiation dose reduction methods were employed.

FINDINGS: In the chest, there is no abnormal lymph node enlargement in the lower neck or axilla. A stable tracheal diverticulum/pseudodiverticulum is present. A new nodule or node is seen in the anterior mediastinum measuring about 16 x 11 mm, while the remaining mediastinal and hilar structures are within normal limits. Previous right cardiophrenic nodules have resolved. The lungs show a few scattered micronodules without significant change and no sizable new lesions. In the abdomen, the liver parenchyma demonstrates uniform enhancement, though a concerning lesion consistent with tumor is noted in the right lobe. Another lesion has decreased in size compared to prior imaging. The gallbladder is unremarkable, and the spleen is normal in size, with no major surface lesions. A nodular density near the posterior wall of the stomach has decreased in size. The pancreas has a normal contour, and a previously noted peritoneal nodule near the pancreatic neck has shrunk. The kidneys appear to enhance normally, with a small calcification in the left kidney unchanged. Small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are below size thresholds for enlargement, and there are smaller peritoneal nodules consistent with metastatic disease, but no obvious new peritoneal fluid. Postsurgical changes from prior hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy are noted; no new pelvic masses are identified. The bones do not exhibit new destructive or blastic changes.

IMPRESSION: There is a persistent and concerning liver tumor, likely metastatic, while several other lesions have decreased in size. A new anterior mediastinal lymph node is seen. Previously noted right cardiophrenic nodules have resolved, and there is no new significant adenopathy. Overall, this suggests partial response or stable disease in some areas, with a new mediastinal node and persistent liver involvement.",,
3,1,0,1,"HISTORY: This study was performed for restaging in a patient with pancreatic cancer.

TECHNIQUE: Unenhanced scans of the liver were obtained, followed by bolus IV administration of about 125 mL of nonionic contrast. Helical images were then acquired through the chest, multiple phases of the liver (35 seconds, 80 seconds, and 4 minutes), and the abdomen and pelvis. Thin-slice axial data were used for coronal and sagittal reformations. Oral contrast was administered. Radiation dose reduction methods and modern CT equipment were used. Prior CT examinations serve as comparison.

FULL RESULT: The chest examination reveals a normal-sized thyroid gland with small nodules suggestive of a stable multinodular pattern, as well as a right-sided venous catheter ending near the atriocaval junction. There is no suspicious pulmonary lesion or pleural effusion, and no enlargement of mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. The heart is of normal size. In the abdomen, the liver contains multiple heterogeneous hypodense lesions across both lobes, consistent with metastatic disease, which remain stable in size and number relative to earlier imaging. A mass in the pancreatic tail, partially cystic and solid, continues to invade the spleen and currently measures about 8.9 x 3.9 cm, slightly decreased from prior measurements. The distal splenic vein is occluded, and there are extensive collateral vessels around the spleen and gastroesophageal region, with a nonocclusive thrombus in the remaining patent portion of the splenic vein. The kidneys have normal contour, though there is concern for new hydronephrosis on the right likely due to ureteral compression by a large pelvic metastatic lesion described below. The stomach, adrenal glands, and gallbladder appear unremarkable. Some small nodules in the peritoneum remain stable and consistent with metastatic disease. In the pelvis, a bulky cystic lesion with fine septations now measures about 14.7 x 13.8 cm, larger than before, and may be compressing the ureters, leading to hydronephrosis. There is irregular bladder wall thickening raising concern for tumor infiltration. No significant fluid collection is seen in the peritoneum, and there is no newly enlarged pelvic lymph node. Skeletal structures show no new destructive or lytic lesions, though a right hip prosthesis remains in place.

IMPRESSION: The pancreatic tail tumor invading the spleen has slightly decreased in dimensions. Bilobar hepatic metastases remain stable. A large cystic pelvic metastatic lesion has significantly enlarged and may be causing urinary obstruction, particularly on the right. Other small peritoneal nodules appear unchanged. The bladder wall shows new thickening suspicious for tumor involvement. Overall, there is stable disease in some areas and progression in the pelvis.",,
4,0,0,1,"HISTORY: This is a restaging CT exam in a patient with pancreatic cancer. A prior MRI cholangiogram is available for correlation.

FULL RESULT: The scan was conducted on a multi-detector CT machine. Precontrast imaging focused on the abdomen, followed by post-contrast imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis after administration of about 125 mL of nonionic IV contrast. Oral contrast was also given. Coronal, sagittal, and axial MIP reconstructions were generated from the chest data, and standard slice thicknesses of 2.5 and 5 mm were produced. Modern CT devices and dose-reducing strategies were employed.

TECHNIQUE: The images were acquired at multiple phases to assess vascular structures and soft tissues comprehensively. The patient�s oral contrast and the injected IV contrast provided good visualization of various abdominal organs and vascular landmarks.

FINDINGS: In the chest, there is no significant enlargement of supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes. The heart is enlarged, with evidence of prior coronary bypass surgery. Multiple calcifications are seen in the coronary arteries. There are peripheral ground-glass opacities mainly in the lower lobes and mild areas of nodularity in the apices, with a lobular right upper lobe nodule measuring up to about 9 mm and a tiny 1 mm subpleural nodule in that region as well. In the abdomen and pelvis, there is a biliary stent in the common bile duct with moderate intrahepatic and pancreatic duct dilatation. Within the head and neck portions of the pancreas, there are small cystic lesions roughly 5 or 6 mm in size, and an ill-defined 21 x 17 mm mass in the pancreatic head surrounds the distal portion of the duct stent, suggesting ongoing obstruction of both bile and pancreatic ducts. The portal vein, splenic vein, and superior mesenteric vessels remain patent. The spleen and adrenal glands appear normal, the gallbladder is mildly distended without gallstones, and the kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis. The bowel loops display no evident obstruction aside from diverticulosis in the colon, and the prostate gland is mildly enlarged. A lymph node in the porta hepatis measures about 16 x 11 mm, which may be metastatic. Smaller retroperitoneal and mesenteric nodes are nonspecific. Skeletal structures show degenerative changes and a healed rib fracture, with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic processes.

IMPRESSION: There is a pancreatic head tumor measuring approximately 21 x 17 mm, contributing to biliary obstruction despite a ductal stent. Several small cystic-appearing lesions in the head and neck of the pancreas may represent IPMN or other cystic neoplasms. A mildly enlarged porta hepatis node is suspicious for metastatic disease. A small lobular nodule in the right upper lung region is indeterminate. Other findings, including cardiac and vascular changes, are noted as described.",,
